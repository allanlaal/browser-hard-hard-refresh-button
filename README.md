# Firefox and Chrome (including all Crhomium based) browser HARD hard refresh

actually Hard refresh tab (clears cookies, cache, session storage AND localStorage)

just like Teslas Full Self Driving is really Tesla not-very-Full Self Driving, all of the firefox/chrome "Hard" Refresh extensions only clear cache at best.

as a developer I often need a totally clean slate for a tab without messing about with Private Windows
